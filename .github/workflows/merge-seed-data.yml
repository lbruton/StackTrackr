# DISABLED — data branch was rebuilt as an orphan (no shared history with dev).
# The spot-poller.yml workflow now uses dual-checkout (dev for code, data for files)
# so scripts no longer need to be synced to the data branch.
# Dev gets price data via live API endpoints, not via branch merge.
#
# To re-enable: rebuild the data branch from dev with shared ancestry,
# or rewrite this workflow to use file-level rsync instead of git merge.
