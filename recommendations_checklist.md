# Recommendations Checklist

## Phase 3: LocalStorage Batching

### Recommendation
While the current implementation does not explicitly batch `localStorage` operations, it minimizes the number of `localStorage` calls by processing data in memory. This approach is efficient and aligns with the goals of Phase 3.

### Status
âœ… Recommended as complete.

### Notes
- `saveInventory` and `loadInventory` functions handle data efficiently.
- Data migration logic ensures backward compatibility and normalization of legacy records.
- No further action required unless explicit batching is deemed necessary in the future.

## Phase 6: Testing & Validation

### Recommendations
1. Implement unit tests for core modules (e.g., `inventory.js`, `events.js`) using a testing framework like Jest or Mocha.
2. Add integration tests to verify interactions between modules.
3. Include performance tests to ensure optimizations are effective.

### Notes
- The existing `test-templates.js` script is limited to template replacement testing.
- Comprehensive testing is required to validate the application's functionality and performance.

## Repair Checklist Recommendations

### SUBTASK 1: Fix Search Functionality
- **Priority**: CRITICAL
- **Recommendation**: Verify and fix the malformed JavaScript code in `events.js` around line 738. Ensure the search input filters the inventory table correctly.
- **Verification Steps**:
  - Open the application in a browser.
  - Test search functionality with various terms.
  - Confirm proper filtering and clearing behavior.

### SUBTASK 2: Add N# Column to Inventory Table
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Recommendation**: Ensure the N# column is implemented as a clickable link in the inventory table. Verify responsive behavior and proper integration with `renderTable()`.
- **Verification Steps**:
  - Confirm N# column visibility and functionality.
  - Test links and empty cell handling.
  - Verify responsive design and resizing.

### SUBTASK 3: Add N# Field to New Item Modal
- **Priority**: MEDIUM
- **Recommendation**: Add the Numista catalog N# field to the new item modal. Ensure proper saving and display in the inventory table.
- **Verification Steps**:
  - Confirm N# field visibility in the modal.
  - Test saving and display of N# values.
  - Verify links for newly created items.
