# Bug Fix: Filter Chip Generalization Issue

## Bug Details
- **ID**: BUG-001
- **Description**: Filter chips for specific coin types (e.g., '2022 American Silver Eagle Special Proof BU') only apply exact matches instead of showing all variations of the coin type.
- **Impact**: Users cannot view all variations of a coin type when clicking on a filter chip, leading to incomplete search results.

## Root Cause
The `simplifyChipValue` function was not being utilized in the filtering logic to generalize coin types.

## Fix Details
- Enhanced the `simplifyChipValue` function to generalize coin type values.
- Updated the `filterInventoryAdvanced` function to ensure broader filtering for coin types based on simplified chip values.

## Testing
- Verified that clicking on a chip for a specific coin type now shows all variations of that coin type.
- Tested with multiple coin types to ensure consistent behavior.

## Notes
This fix ensures that users can view all variations of a coin type when clicking on a filter chip, improving search results and user experience.
