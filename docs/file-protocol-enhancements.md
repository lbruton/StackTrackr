# File Protocol Compatibility Fixes - Phase 2

## Enhanced Solutions for File Protocol Issues

This document outlines additional fixes implemented to ensure full compatibility with the `file://` protocol.

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Module Exports in Browser Environment
- **Problem**: `fuzzy-search.js` was using Node.js `module.exports` which isn't available in browsers
- **Solution**: Replaced with direct window object assignments using `window.fuzzySearch`

### 2. Duplicate Function Definitions
- **Problem**: Multiple implementations of the `debounce` function causing syntax errors
- **Solution**: Centralized in `utils.js` and exposed globally via `window.debounce`

### 3. Function Shadowing Errors
- **Problem**: Multiple declarations of `loadInventory` function causing shadowing errors
- **Solution**: Converted duplicate implementation to a fallback that's only used if the main one isn't available

### 4. Missing Function References
- **Problem**: Functions like `toggleCollectable` and `updateSummary` not available when needed
- **Solution**: Added global exposures and stub implementations in `file-protocol-fix.js`

### 5. Cross-Origin Fetch Requests
- **Problem**: `fetch()` API doesn't work with file:// protocol due to security restrictions
- **Solution**: 
  - Added fetch interception to provide better error messages
  - Created hardcoded fallbacks for critical content like announcements
  - Prevented CORS errors by handling file:// protocol specially

## Implementation Details

### Global Function Exposure Pattern
Functions are now consistently exposed using:
```javascript
if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
  window.functionName = functionName;
}
```

### Error Handling with Retries
Critical function calls now include:
1. Availability check before calling
2. Safe fallback if not available
3. Retry logic with timeouts

### Stub Implementation Pattern
Stubs provide temporary functionality until real implementations load:
```javascript
window.functionName = function stubFunctionName() {
  console.warn('Stub functionName called - waiting for real implementation');
  // Minimal implementation to prevent errors
};
```

## Testing
To thoroughly test these changes:
1. Test with HTTP server (normal operation)
2. Test with file:// protocol (compatibility mode)
3. Verify no console errors in either mode
4. Check that all functionality works in both environments

## Future Improvements
1. Implement a proper module system with dependency management
2. Create a dedicated file-protocol compatibility layer
3. Use service workers for more robust local file handling
4. Add comprehensive error reporting system
