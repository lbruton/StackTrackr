# Documentation Consolidation - LLM.md Removal

## Change Summary
**Date**: August 8, 2025  
**Action**: Removed redundant `docs/LLM.md` file  
**Reason**: Superseded by more comprehensive `docs/MULTI_AGENT_WORKFLOW.md`

## Analysis
The original `docs/LLM.md` served as a general AI assistant guide but contained:
- ❌ Outdated version references (v3.1.9)
- ❌ Limited actionable guidance
- ❌ Significant overlap with new workflow documentation
- ❌ No specific quality standards or coordination protocols

## Replacement
`docs/MULTI_AGENT_WORKFLOW.md` provides:
- ✅ **Complete project context** - Everything from LLM.md plus more
- ✅ **Current v3.2.07rc focus** - Up-to-date technical information
- ✅ **Actionable workflow guidance** - Specific step-by-step processes
- ✅ **Quality standards** - Testing and validation protocols
- ✅ **Coordination system** - Multi-agent conflict prevention
- ✅ **Comprehensive architecture** - Detailed technical context

## File Location
- **Removed**: `docs/LLM.md` 
- **Archived**: `docs/archive/LLM.md` (for historical reference)
- **Primary Guide**: `docs/MULTI_AGENT_WORKFLOW.md`

## Documentation Updates Needed
- ✅ No cross-references found that need updating
- ✅ No workflow documents reference LLM.md
- ✅ Clean removal with no breaking references

## Future AI Assistant Handoffs
Use this single command for any AI agent:

```
Please read docs/MULTI_AGENT_WORKFLOW.md for complete project context 
and development workflow guidance, then select an available subtask 
from docs/ROADMAP.md.
```

The consolidated approach eliminates documentation redundancy while providing more comprehensive and actionable guidance for AI assistants.
