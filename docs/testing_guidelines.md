# StackTrackr Testing Guidelines

## Overview
All test files must be placed in the `/tests` folder. This ensures a clean, organized workspace and prevents test artifacts from cluttering the main codebase.

---

## Test File Organization
  - HTML test files (e.g., `file-protocol-test.html`, `theme-test.html`)
  - JavaScript test files (e.g., `final-validation.test.js`, `import-export-comprehensive.test.js`)
  - Performance and compatibility tests


## Guidelines for Agents

## Next Steps
- Future versions will include detailed test strategies, sample cases, and browser compatibility checklists
- For now, focus on keeping the `/tests` folder clean and complete

---

## For Future Agents
- Always check `/tests` for existing test files before adding new ones
- Update this document with new testing standards as the project evolves
