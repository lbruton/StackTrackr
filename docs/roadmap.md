# StackrTrackr - Development Roadmap

This roadmap tracks upcoming goals without committing to specific patch numbers. Items can be added using: "Add X to Roadmap" or "Add Y to Buglist".

---

## üö® **CRITICAL BUGS** (Fix ASAP)
- [ ] The Last Sync time/date is incorrectly recording the last time the user pressed the sync button; this should be the last API pull
- [ ] Unknown items and "Imported by *" items should always sort after items with valid values
- [ ] Correct issue with readme date inconsistencies

## üêõ **BUG FIXES** (Non-critical)
- [ ] Reset button and change log button need redesigned - current styling/positioning needs improvement
- [ ] Calculations on the Totals card appear to be incorrect, possibly omitting the collectable weight from melt price calculations?
- [ ] Fuzzy search filter shows American Gold Eagle when typing "Eagle" or "Silver Eagle" - needs refinement
- [ ] Error recovery procedures missing for critical failures
- [ ] Data corruption detection and recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Agent coordination timeout mechanisms
- [ ] Memory leak detection for long-running sessions
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility edge cases
- [ ] localStorage quota limit handling

## üîß **FEATURE ENHANCEMENTS** (Improve existing)
- [ ] Add a total item counter at the lower right corner of the table
- [ ] When importing data, if no value is present, check other Numista price values. If none, set the price to 0.00
- [ ] When opening Numista links, open them in a new, appropriately sized window with close, back, and forward controls
- [ ] "Change Log" should have a square recycle bin icon instead of text
- [ ] In the table, when filtered, dynamically remove empty columns
- [ ] When the width narrows to mobile sizes, double the height of the table rows
- [ ] Re-theme the light mode with the new "Darker Light" palette
- [ ] Add exponential backoff and a user-visible retry banner for API rate limits
- [ ] Move the "Minimum Chip Items" dropdown under the "Items" dropdown
- [ ] Add a checkbox under the "Minimum Chip Items" dropdown to include date and price values for all cells
- [ ] Add a toggle to enable/disable weight in the filters tool
- [ ] Provide a toggle to switch between a condensed, scrolling view and an auto-expanding view
- [ ] Group all control toggles into a card under the "Items" dropdown
- [ ] The "Title/Name" column should allow fractions
- [ ] Center the titles and subtitles on the cards in the files modal
- [ ] Add "You may be entitled to compensation" to the boating accident joke, scaled to fit under the button
- [ ] Add "Purchase" and "Issue" year filters
- [ ] Performance monitoring and baseline measurements
- [ ] Integration testing framework for multi-agent workflows
- [ ] Automated testing for localStorage quota limits
- [ ] Security audit automation and scheduling

## ‚≠ê **NEW FEATURES** (Add functionality)
- [ ] Develop a marketing website for StackTrackr download - create a professional landing page with screenshots, feature highlights, download instructions, and user testimonials to showcase what the tool can do
- [ ] Bulk inline editing tool - restore and enhance the previous bulk edit functionality that allowed editing entire rows at once without breaking table structure
- [ ] Create a Debug API Button that opens a modal showing the API response in text/JSON and a table

- [ ] Advanced dependency resolution for agent tasks
- [ ] User experience metrics collection
- [ ] Automated CI/CD pipeline integration

## üèóÔ∏è **BACKEND & ARCHITECTURE** (Infrastructure)

## üöÄ **LONG-TERM VISION** (Future releases)

### Version Goals (v4.x)
- Implement drag-and-drop dashboard system with customizable card layouts - users can rearrange spot price cards, totals cards, and entire dashboard sections (major undertaking, likely requires framework adoption)
- Remove file:// protocol support and adopt a framework

### Version Goals (v3.5)
- **Final file:// protocol release** - Last version supporting local file protocol
- **Final public branch release** - After v3.5, development moves to private branch for website development
- **Privacy-first foundation** - Establish core privacy architecture before adding connected features
- **Public branch maintenance** - Periodic updates pushed back with server-side features removed

### Major Milestone Roadmap
- **Encrypted Backup Export** ‚Äî Provide a secure backup flow that encrypts user data and produces a downloadable archive ready for cloud storage (e.g., Google Drive). **[NEXT PRIORITY]**
- **Turso Sync and SQLite Support** ‚Äî Offer optional Turso integration so users can connect API credentials and synchronize their data with a remote SQLite-compatible database. **[HIGH PRIORITY]**
- **Numista API Integration** ‚Äî Finalize the Numista API integration to support direct item and collectible price lookups integrated into search functionality. This includes building a cached search worker for the public site to power autocomplete features and an opt-in system for users to pull data. **[MAJOR MILESTONE]**
- **Companion Server Applet for Price History** ‚Äî Develop a server-side companion application that polls metals APIs regularly and maintains historical price databases, allowing the main application to pull updated price histories on demand. **[MAJOR MILESTONE]**
- **Privacy-First Community Data Sharing** ‚Äî Explore opt-in mechanisms for community members to share anonymized market data, pricing insights, or collection trends while maintaining strict privacy controls and user consent. Initial implementation: optional checkbox next to buy price for numismatic items that bundles item/price/date anonymously to server companion, creating a community-driven pricing database similar to Numista's model. This feature presents significant privacy challenges that must be carefully architected. **[DREAM FEATURE]**
- **Privacy-First Connected Services** ‚Äî All features that require external connectivity will be strictly opt-in, ensuring user privacy is the default. We will never gather personal data or store user data without explicit consent.
- **Hosted API Cache & Data Worker** ‚Äî Develop a cloud worker to build a historical price database by polling APIs daily and monthly. This will provide a robust data source for the hosted version of the application.
- **Encrypted Backup Export** ‚Äî Provide a secure backup flow that encrypts user data and produces a downloadable archive ready for cloud storage (e.g., Google Drive).
- **Fuzzy Search Across All Data** ‚Äî Complete the fuzzy search integration to enable typo-tolerant, context-aware search functionality spanning every stored field, improving data discoverability.
- **Numista API Integration** ‚Äî Finalize the Numista API integration to support direct item and collectible price lookups. This includes building a cached search worker for the public site to power autocomplete features and an opt-in system for users to pull data.
- **Turso Sync and SQLite Support** ‚Äî Offer optional Turso integration so users can connect API credentials and synchronize their data with a remote SQLite-compatible database.
- **Lightweight Storage Options** ‚Äî Expand supported storage back ends to accommodate constrained devices and alternate persistence layers.
- **Enhanced CSV Conversion Tools** ‚Äî Improve import/export utilities for cleaner conversions, broader compatibility, and error handling.
- **Advanced In-line and Batch Editing** ‚Äî Introduce powerful editing workflows:
  - Full-featured edit panel to query the Numista database cache and correct item attributes.
  - Find and replace functionality.
  - In-line editing for all values in the table.
  - An algorithm to identify and suggest structural improvements for item names based on common patterns.
- **Comprehensive Charts and Graphs** ‚Äî Deliver robust visual analytics‚Äîtrend lines, distribution charts, and comparative dashboards‚Äîto help users explore their collections.
