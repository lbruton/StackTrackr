# File Protocol Compatibility Fix

## Problem Summary

The StackTrackr application was experiencing issues when run via the `file://` protocol due to:

1. Conflicting implementations of `saveData` and `loadData` functions in `utils.js` and `inventory.js`
2. Timing issues with script loading causing "Stub loadInventory called before real implementation loaded" warnings
3. Duplicate function declarations causing undefined behavior

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Utility Function Conflict Resolution
- Modified `inventory.js` to check if utility functions already exist before defining them
- Used window-scoped references to ensure consistent function access
- Added debug logging to track real implementation calls

### 2. Global Function Exposure
- Explicitly exposed key functions to the global scope:
  - `saveInventory`
  - `loadInventory`
  - `sanitizeTablesOnLoad`
- Added early binding to make functions available as soon as possible

### 3. Stub Function Improvement
- Enhanced the stub implementation in `file-protocol-fix.js`
- Added proper warning message for stub function calls
- Ensured seamless transition from stub to real implementation

### 4. Initialization Robustness
- Added retry logic in `init.js` for delayed function availability
- Improved error handling with explicit try/catch blocks
- Added detailed debug logging for troubleshooting

## Files Modified
1. `/js/inventory.js` - Fixed function definitions and global exposures
2. `/js/file-protocol-fix.js` - Improved stub implementation
3. `/js/init.js` - Added robust initialization with fallbacks

## Testing
The application should now:
1. Load properly via both HTTP and file:// protocols
2. Maintain all functionality across different browsers
3. Handle script loading order variations gracefully
4. Provide useful debug messages if issues occur

## Future Improvements
1. Consider implementing module pattern to avoid global namespace pollution
2. Add formal dependency injection system for better function availability tracking
3. Add comprehensive loading state tracking to prevent premature function calls
