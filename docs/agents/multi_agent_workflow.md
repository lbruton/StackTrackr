# Multi-Agent Development Workflow - StackrTrackr v3.04.34

> **‚ö†Ô∏è NOTICE: `docs/agents/agents.ai` is the primary development reference for token efficiency. This file is maintained for consistency only.**

> **Latest release: v3.04.34**

## üéØ Project Overview

You are contributing to **StackrTrackr v3.04.33**, a comprehensive client-side web application for tracking precious metal investments (Silver, Gold, Platinum, Palladium). The project uses a modular JavaScript architecture with local storage, responsive CSS theming, and advanced features like API integration, data visualization, and comprehensive import/export capabilities.

**Current Status**: v3.04.34 (stable)
**Your Role**: Complete focused v3.04.x patch tasks as part of a coordinated multi-agent development effort

---

## üèóÔ∏è Multi-Agent Workflow

### **How This Works**
- Development progresses through incremental **v3.04.x patch releases**
- Each patch entry is designed for **~2 hour completion**
- **Multiple agents work in parallel** on different patch entries
- **Coordination system** prevents conflicts and ensures quality
- **Roadmap entries** track progress and assignments

### **Your Responsibilities**
1. **Pick up an available patch entry** from the roadmap
2. **Check dependencies or prerequisites** before starting work
3. **Complete the patch** following quality standards
4. **Test your changes** thoroughly
5. **Bump the version and update all docs** after completing the patch
6. **Document your work** and any findings
7. **Mark the patch entry as complete** in the roadmap

---

## üìã How to Get Started

### **Step 1: Read the Documentation**
Before starting any patch entry, read these files:
- `docs/roadmap.md` - Patch release roadmap (v3.04.x entries)
- `docs/agents/agents.ai` - Current development context and notes
- `docs/status.md` - Current project status
- `docs/structure.md` - Project architecture and file organization
- `docs/ui_style_guide.md` - UI color, typography, and component conventions
- `docs/functionstable.md` - Reference table of all JavaScript functions

### **Step 2: Choose Your Patch Entry**
1. **Review available patch entries** in `docs/roadmap.md`
2. **Check dependencies** ‚Äì some patches require others to complete first
3. **Verify file conflicts** ‚Äì avoid working on high-conflict files simultaneously
4. **Announce your choice** if coordinating with other agents

### **Step 3: Understand the Context**
- **Read the current codebase** in the relevant files
- **Understand existing patterns** and architecture
- **Review related patches** to understand the bigger picture
- **Check for any existing work** that might affect your patch

## üéØ Patch Execution Guidelines

### **Quality Standards (Required for Every Patch)**

#### ‚úÖ **Functional Testing**
- Verify your changes work as intended
- Test with both empty and populated data
- Check all user interaction scenarios
- Verify mobile and desktop responsiveness
- Test all three themes (dark, light, sepia)

#### ‚úÖ **Integration Testing**  
- Ensure no breaking changes to existing features
- Test spot price calculations, inventory management, search, etc.
- Verify import/export functionality still works
- Check theme switching and modal behavior
- Test file:// protocol compatibility

#### ‚úÖ **Code Quality**
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Use consistent naming and formatting
- Add JSDoc comments for new functions
- Keep functions focused and modular
- Use existing utility functions where possible

#### ‚úÖ **Browser Compatibility**
- Test in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- Verify file:// protocol compatibility (open index.html directly)
- Check mobile browsers if making UI changes
- Test with localStorage enabled/disabled
- Verify external library compatibility

#### ‚úÖ **Documentation Updates**
- Update relevant code comments
- Add any new configuration to constants.js
- Update planning notes if you discover issues
- Document any architectural decisions
- For every completed patch, **bump the version** and update:
  - `js/constants.js` - Update APP_VERSION
  - `docs/functionstable.md` - Add new functions
  - `docs/changelog.md` - Document changes
  - `docs/roadmap.md` - Mark entry complete
  - `docs/agents/multi_agent_workflow.md` - Update version references

### **File Modification Guidelines**

#### **HIGH CONFLICT RISK FILES** ‚ö†Ô∏è (Coordinate Carefully)
- `index.html` - Main application structure, frequently modified
- `js/events.js` - Central event handler logic, complex dependencies
- `css/styles.css` - Shared styling, theme-dependent

**When working on these files:**
- Check with other agents working nearby patches
- Make focused, minimal changes
- Test thoroughly for conflicts
- Document exactly what you changed
- Use git-style diffs when possible

#### **MEDIUM CONFLICT RISK FILES** ‚ö†Ô∏è
- `js/api.js` - API integration logic
- `js/inventory.js` - Core data management
- `js/theme.js` - Theme switching logic

#### **LOW CONFLICT RISK FILES** ‚úÖ (Safe for Parallel Work)
- Documentation files (.md)
- Individual modal HTML/CSS sections
- Utility functions
- New feature modules
- `js/constants.js` (except version changes)

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Context

### **Current Architecture:**
- **Client-side only** - No server dependencies, works from file://
- **Modular JavaScript** - Separate files for different concerns
- **Local storage** - All data persisted locally using localStorage
- **Responsive CSS** - Mobile-first design with 3 themes (dark/light/sepia)
- **External libraries** - Chart.js, Papa Parse, XLSX, jsPDF, JSZip loaded from CDN

### **Key Data Structures:**
- **`inventory`** - Array of inventory items with all metadata

- **`spotHistory`** - Historical price tracking with timestamps
- **`apiConfig`** - API provider configuration and keys
- **`elements`** - Cached DOM elements for performance
- **`catalogMap`** - Serial number to catalog ID mapping

### **Important Constants:**
- **`APP_VERSION`** - Current version (in `js/constants.js`)
- **`METALS`** - Metal configuration object with defaults
- **Storage keys** - LocalStorage key constants
- **API providers** - Configuration for supported metal pricing APIs

---

## üîç Debugging and Testing

### **Testing Your Changes:**
1. **Open `index.html`** directly in browser (file:// protocol)
2. **Import sample data** using `sample.csv`
3. **Test core workflows** - add items, edit, search, export
4. **Try edge cases** - empty data, large datasets, invalid inputs
5. **Check responsive design** - Mobile and desktop views
6. **Test all three themes** - Dark, light, and sepia modes
7. **Test API functionality** - If you have API keys configured
8. **Verify localStorage** - Data persistence across browser sessions

### **Common Issues to Watch For:**
- **LocalStorage quota** - Large inventories might hit 5-10MB limits
- **Date parsing** - Multiple date formats need proper handling
- **XSS prevention** - All user input must be sanitized
- **Mobile compatibility** - Touch events, small screens, virtual keyboards
- **File protocol** - Some features work differently from file://
- **Theme consistency** - Components should work in all three themes
- **API rate limits** - Respect provider quotas and caching

### **Performance Considerations:**
- **Large inventories** - Use pagination and debounced search
- **Chart rendering** - Canvas performance with many data points
- **ZIP processing** - Show progress indicators for large files
- **Search filtering** - Debounce input for responsive filtering
- **Modal animations** - Smooth transitions without blocking UI

### **Browser-Specific Issues:**
- **Safari** - Date input formatting, localStorage quotas
- **Firefox** - File download behavior, theme detection
- **Chrome** - Memory usage with large datasets
- **Edge** - Legacy compatibility considerations
- **Mobile browsers** - Touch events, keyboard behavior

- Security considerations or potential vulnerabilities

### **How to Report Issues:**
- Update relevant documentation with technical discoveries
- Document workarounds for browser-specific issues  
- Note any security considerations or input validation needs
- Flag breaking changes or API modifications clearly
- Provide reproduction steps for bugs discovered
- Suggest testing scenarios for related patches
