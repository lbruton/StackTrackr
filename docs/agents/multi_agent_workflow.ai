## üèóÔ∏è Multi-Agent Workflow

# Multi-Agent Workflow (MCP-Powered)

This document outlines the AI-assisted development workflow for the StackTrackr project, leveraging a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for real-time context and a multi-agent strategy for specialized tasks.

## Core Concepts

1.  **MCP Server**: A VS Code extension (`VSCode MCP Server`) runs in the background, providing any connected AI with a live, comprehensive understanding of the entire workspace. This includes all files, code structures, diagnostics, and project documentation.

2.  **`@workspace` Command**: This is the primary way to interact with the MCP server. By starting a prompt with `@workspace`, the active AI agent receives the full project context, ensuring its responses are accurate and relevant to the current state of the code.

3.  **Lightweight Agent Personas**: Instead of large, static context files, each agent has a small `.ai` file in this directory (`docs/agents/`). This file defines the agent's specific role and instructs it to use `@workspace` for context.

4.  **Task Delegation**: We use different AI models based on their strengths, as defined in `workflow.ai`. The general flow is:
    *   **Plan & Audit** with Gemini.
    *   **Build & Implement** with GPT.
    *   **Refactor & Document** with Claude.

## Standard Operating Procedure

1.  **Choose Your Agent**: Select the appropriate agent (Gemini, GPT, Claude) in VS Code based on the task you need to perform.
2.  **Invoke the Workspace**: Start your request with `@workspace` to give the agent full context.
3.  **Delegate and Develop**: Follow the task delegation guide in `workflow.ai` to efficiently move through the development cycle.

## Context Management

To ensure conversations don't exceed the model's context window, use the built-in handoff command.

-   **Command**: `Prepare Handoff`
-   **Action**: When you give this command, the agent will summarize the current state of work and provide a "Continuation Prompt".
-   **Workflow**: Start a new chat and use this continuation prompt as the first message to seamlessly pick up where you left off.

## Fallback Plan (Offline or No-MCP)

If the MCP server is unavailable (e.g., working in a different editor), a fallback system is in place.

-   **Location**: `docs/agents/fallback/`
-   **Contents**: This directory contains the "classic" style `.ai` files with detailed, static context manually embedded.
-   **Usage**: In an environment without MCP, temporarily configure the AI to use the instruction files from this directory to provide it with a functional, albeit not real-time, understanding of the project.

## üìã How to Get Started

### **Step 1: Read the Documentation**
Before starting any patch entry, read these files:
- `docs/roadmap.md` - Patch release roadmap (v3.04.x entries)
- `docs/agents/agents.ai` - Current development context and notes
- `docs/status.md` - Current project status
- `docs/structure.md` - Project architecture and file organization
- `docs/ui_style_guide.md` - UI color, typography, and component conventions
- `docs/functionstable.md` - Reference table of all JavaScript functions

### **Step 2: Choose Your Patch Entry**
1. **Review available patch entries** in `docs/roadmap.md`
2. **Check dependencies** ‚Äì some patches require others to complete first
3. **Verify file conflicts** ‚Äì avoid working on high-conflict files simultaneously
4. **Announce your choice** if coordinating with other agents

### **Step 3: Understand the Context**
- **Read the current codebase** in the relevant files
- **Understand existing patterns** and architecture
- **Review related patches** to understand the bigger picture
- **Check for any existing work** that might affect your patch

## üéØ Patch Execution Guidelines

### **Quality Standards (Required for Every Patch)**

#### ‚úÖ **Functional Testing**
- Verify your changes work as intended
- Test with both empty and populated data
- Check all user interaction scenarios
- Verify mobile and desktop responsiveness
- Test all three themes (dark, light, sepia)

#### ‚úÖ **Integration Testing**  
- Ensure no breaking changes to existing features
- Test spot price calculations, inventory management, search, etc.
- Verify import/export functionality still works
- Check theme switching and modal behavior
- Test file:// protocol compatibility

#### ‚úÖ **Code Quality**
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Use consistent naming and formatting
- Add JSDoc comments for new functions
- Keep functions focused and modular
- Use existing utility functions where possible

#### ‚úÖ **Browser Compatibility**
- Test in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge

- Test with localStorage enabled/disabled
- Verify external library compatibility

#### ‚úÖ **Documentation Updates**
- Update relevant code comments
- Add any new configuration to constants.js
- Update planning notes if you discover issues

### **File Modification Guidelines**

#### **HIGH CONFLICT RISK FILES** ‚ö†Ô∏è (Coordinate Carefully)
- `index.html` - Main application structure, frequently modified
- `js/events.js` - Central event handler logic, complex dependencies
- `css/styles.css` - Shared styling, theme-dependent

**When working on these files:**
- Check with other agents working nearby patches
- Make focused, minimal changes
- Test thoroughly for conflicts
- Document exactly what you changed
- Use git-style diffs when possible

#### **MEDIUM CONFLICT RISK FILES** ‚ö†Ô∏è
- `js/api.js` - API integration logic
- `js/inventory.js` - Core data management
- `js/theme.js` - Theme switching logic

#### **LOW CONFLICT RISK FILES** ‚úÖ (Safe for Parallel Work)
- Documentation files (.md)
- Individual modal HTML/CSS sections
- Utility functions
- New feature modules
- `js/constants.js` (except version changes)

## üîç Debugging and Testing

### **Testing Your Changes:**
1. **Open `index.html`** directly in browser (file:// protocol)
2. **Import sample data** using `sample.csv`
3. **Test core workflows** - add items, edit, search, export
4. **Try edge cases** - empty data, large datasets, invalid inputs
5. **Check responsive design** - Mobile and desktop views
6. **Test all three themes** - Dark, light, and sepia modes
7. **Test API functionality** - If you have API keys configured
8. **Verify localStorage** - Data persistence across browser sessions

### **Common Issues to Watch For:**
- **LocalStorage quota** - Large inventories might hit 5-10MB limits
- **Date parsing** - Multiple date formats need proper handling
- **XSS prevention** - All user input must be sanitized
- **Mobile compatibility** - Touch events, small screens, virtual keyboards
- **File protocol** - Some features work differently from file://
- **Theme consistency** - Components should work in all three themes
- **API rate limits** - Respect provider quotas and caching

### **Performance Considerations:**
- **Large inventories** - Use pagination and debounced search
- **Chart rendering** - Canvas performance with many data points
- **ZIP processing** - Show progress indicators for large files
- **Search filtering** - Debounce input for responsive filtering
- **Modal animations** - Smooth transitions without blocking UI

### **Browser-Specific Issues:**
- **Safari** - Date input formatting, localStorage quotas
- **Firefox** - File download behavior, theme detection
- **Chrome** - Memory usage with large datasets
- **Edge** - Legacy compatibility considerations
- **Mobile browsers** - Touch events, keyboard behavior
