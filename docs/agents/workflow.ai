# Agent Task Delegation Guide

This guide helps delegate tasks to the most suitable AI agent for the job, based on the roles we've defined for the StackTrackr project. By following this model, you can create a powerful assembly line for development: **Plan with Gemini, Build with GPT, and Refine with Claude.**

### 1. Gemini (The Strategist & Guardian)
- **Primary Role**: Security Auditor & Roadmap Planner.
- **Delegate When You Need To**:
    - **Plan**: Ask for high-level plans, architectural suggestions, or step-by-step outlines for new features.
