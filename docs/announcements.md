## What's New

- **Shift+click inline editing (v3.07.02)**: Hold Shift and click any editable cell (Name, Qty, Weight, Purchase Price, Retail Price, Location) to edit in place. Enter saves, Escape cancels. Removed pencil icon and save/cancel buttons — clean keyboard-only editing
- **Light & Sepia theme contrast pass (v3.07.01)**: Clean gray-to-white light palette with visible card elevation. Darkened metal/type text colors to pass WCAG AA in both themes. Estimated Retail/Gain-Loss now uses muted text color instead of opacity
- **Portfolio visibility overhaul (v3.07.00)**: Confidence styling for Retail/Gain-Loss (estimated vs confirmed), new "All Metals" totals card with Avg Cost/oz and clickable breakdown modal, metal detail modals now show full portfolio breakdown per type and location

## Development Roadmap

- **Filter chips rebuild**: Top-N per category model, normalized name chips, chip settings modal
- **N# column restore**: Re-add Numista catalog column with filter-on-click and iframe link
- **Numista API fix**: Correct endpoints, auth headers, and parameters in the NumistaProvider class
- **Mobile card view**: Responsive layout that switches from table to card-based view on small screens
