## What's New

- **DiffMerge Integration (v3.33.19)**: Selective apply for cloud sync pull and encrypted vault restore. DiffModal preview replaces full overwrite — users choose which changes to accept. Shared _applyAndFinalize helper consolidates post-apply sequence
- **Diff/Merge Architecture Foundation (v3.33.18)**: Manifest path constants, pruning threshold storage key, diffReviewModal HTML scaffold, and diff-modal.js script registration for the reusable change-review UI
- **Realized Gains/Losses (v3.33.17)**: Disposition workflow to mark items as Sold, Traded, Lost, Gifted, or Returned. Calculates realized gain/loss, adds disposition badges, filter toggle, portfolio summary breakdown, and CSV export columns
- **Clone Mode Redesign (v3.33.16)**: Clone button activates clone mode on the edit modal with field-level checkboxes. Edit modal sections always visible, date N/A restyled as toggle button, Numista refresh button removed

## Development Roadmap

### Next Up

- **Market Page Phase 3**: Inventory-to-market linking with auto-update retail prices
- **Cloud Backup Conflict Detection (STAK-150)**: Smarter conflict resolution using item count direction, not just timestamps
- **Accessible Table Mode (STAK-144)**: Style D with horizontal scroll, long-press to edit, 300% zoom support
