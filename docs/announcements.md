## What's New

- **STACK-45: Goldback denomination pricing**: New `gb` weight unit for Goldback items — 1 gb = 0.001 ozt 24K gold. Manual denomination pricing in Settings > Goldback tab with save, history logging, and enable/disable toggle. Retail value uses 3-tier hierarchy: manual override > Goldback denomination price > melt value. CSV/PDF/ZIP exports include Weight Unit column. Edit and duplicate preserve gb unit
- **STACK-43: Silent price history**: Per-item price history now records silently in the background. Every add, edit, bulk change, and spot price sync captures a timestamped retail/spot/melt snapshot keyed by UUID. When trend charts ship, you'll already have months of data. ZIP backup includes price history with smart merge on restore
- **STACK-42: Persistent UUIDs**: Every inventory item now has a stable UUID v4 identifier that never changes regardless of array position. Foundation for per-item price history, trend charts, and cloud sync. Existing items auto-migrate on load. All export/import formats updated

Changed: Extracted inline test loader to js/test-loader.js (STACK-25). Changed: CSV, PDF, and ZIP exports now include Purity column. Changed: Seed data includes realistic purity values for sample items

Seed timestamp: Spot cards show 'Seed · date' with shift+click hint for seeded users. Metals History: Seed entries visible in history modal with StakTrakr source label.
