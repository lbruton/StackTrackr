# Timestamp Display Implementation - v3.1.5

## Overview
Added timestamp display to spot price cards showing when each metal price was last updated.

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified
- `app/index.html` - Added `spot-card-timestamp` elements to all metal cards
- `app/css/styles.css` - Added `.spot-card-timestamp` styling (small, muted text)
- `app/js/utils.js` - Added `getLastUpdateTime(metalName)` function
- `app/js/spot.js` - Updated spot price functions to display timestamps
- `app/js/constants.js` - Version bumped to 3.1.5

### Key Function
```javascript
getLastUpdateTime(metalName) // Returns HTML: "Source<br>Last sync YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS - Xd Xh ago"
```

### Features
- Two-line display separating source and sync time
- Absolute timestamp with relative age (days + hours)
- Source indicators (API, Cached, Manual, Default, Stored)
- Auto-updates when prices change
- Uses existing spotHistory data structure

## User Experience
- Timestamps appear below spot prices in muted text
- Shows data freshness at a glance
- Helps users understand data source and recency

## Future Considerations
- Could add click-to-refresh functionality
- Could show full timestamp on hover
- Could add color coding for data age
