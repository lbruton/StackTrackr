# StackrTrackr Repair Checklist - v3.04.05

## 🚨 **Critical Issues to Fix**

### **SUBTASK 1: Fix Search Functionality**
**Priority: CRITICAL**
**Estimated Time: 15 minutes**

**Problem**: Search input not responding due to malformed JavaScript in events.js

**Prompt**: "Fix the malformed JavaScript code in events.js around line 738. There's a standalone 'n' character that's breaking the search functionality. Remove the malformed code and ensure the search input properly filters the inventory table when users type in the search box."

**Files to Modify**:
- `js/events.js` (fix malformed code around line 738)

**Verification Steps**:
- [ ] Open application in browser
- [ ] Type in search box 
- [ ] Confirm table filters properly
- [ ] Test search with various terms (metal names, item names, etc.)
- [ ] Verify search clearing works properly

---

### **SUBTASK 2: Add N# Column to Inventory Table**
**Priority: HIGH**
**Estimated Time: 45 minutes**

**Problem**: Numista catalog numbers (N#) are stored in the data but not displayed in the main inventory table

**Prompt**: "Add a new 'N#' column to the inventory table that displays the Numista catalog number when available. The N# should appear as a clickable link that opens https://en.numista.com/catalogue/pieces{N#}.html in a new tab when an N# exists. If no N# exists, show empty cell. Add this column between the 'Name' and 'Qty' columns."

**Files to Modify**:
- `index.html` (add N# header to table)
- `js/inventory.js` (update renderTable function to include N# column)
- `css/styles.css` (add responsive hiding rules for N# column if needed)

**Implementation Requirements**:
- [x] Add `<th>` for N# column in table header
- [x] Update `renderTable()` function to include N# cell
- [x] Format N# as clickable link: `https://en.numista.com/catalogue/pieces{N#}.html`
- [x] Handle empty N# values gracefully
- [x] Ensure proper responsive behavior
- [x] Add N# to column resizing functionality

**Verification Steps**:
- [x] N# column visible in table
- [x] Clickable links work when N# present
- [x] Empty cells when no N# available  
- [x] Column resizes properly
- [x] Responsive design still works

---

### **SUBTASK 3: Add N# Field to New Item Modal**
**Priority: MEDIUM**
**Estimated Time: 20 minutes**

**Problem**: New item modal missing catalog/N# field that edit modal has

**Prompt**: "Add the Numista catalog N# field to the new item modal to match the edit item modal. The field should be labeled 'Catalog (N#)' and placed in the same location as in the edit modal. Update the form submission handler to save the N# value when creating new items."

**Files to Modify**:
- `index.html` (add N# field to new item modal)
- `js/events.js` (update form submission to handle N# field)

**Implementation Requirements**:
- [x] Add catalog input field to new item modal form
- [x] Update form submission handler for new items
- [x] Ensure N# gets properly saved to `numistaId` field
- [x] Match styling and placement with edit modal

**Verification Steps**:
- [x] N# field visible in new item modal
- [x] N# field saves properly when creating items
- [x] Created items show N# in table if provided
- [x] N# links work for newly created items

---

### **SUBTASK 4: Improve N# Import/Export Handling**
**Priority: MEDIUM**  
**Estimated Time: 30 minutes**

**Problem**: Verify N# import/export functionality is working properly

**Prompt**: "Review and verify that Numista N# values are properly imported from CSV/Numista files and exported in all formats (CSV, Excel, JSON, PDF). Ensure the N# field is included in all export formats and properly mapped during imports. Test with sample data to confirm round-trip data integrity."

**Files to Modify**:
- `js/inventory.js` (verify export functions include N#)
- `js/inventory.js` (verify import functions map N# properly)

**Verification Steps**:
- [x] Import Numista CSV with N# values
- [x] Confirm N# values appear in table after import
- [x] Export to CSV and verify N# included
- [x] Export to Excel and verify N# included  
- [x] Export to JSON and verify N# included
- [x] Export to PDF and verify N# included
- [x] Test round-trip: import → edit → export → import

Maintain full backward compatibility with existing data structures."

**Implementation Requirements**:
- [x] Create `CatalogManager` class to replace basic `catalogMap`

- [x] `js/inventory.js` (implement CatalogManager integration)
- [x] Create new `js/catalog-manager.js` file

**Verification Steps**:
- [x] All existing N# data loads correctly
- [x] Import/export functions work unchanged
- [x] No data loss during migration
- [x] Storage size optimization measurable

---

#### **PHASE 1C: Storage Optimization & Efficiency (45 minutes)**
**Prompt**: "Optimize localStorage usage for the enhanced catalog mapping system. Implement compression, deduplication, and efficient storage patterns to minimize localStorage footprint while maintaining fast access to catalog data. Add storage monitoring and cleanup utilities."

**Implementation Requirements**:
- [ ] Implement data compression for catalog storage

Create a provider-agnostic architecture that can handle different catalog systems (Numista, NGC, PCGS, etc.) while maintaining the current Numista functionality. Design the system for easy addition of new providers."

**Implementation Requirements**:
- [x] Create `CatalogProvider` interface/base class

- [ ] Provider system ready for expansion
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing functionality
- [ ] Documentation complete for adding new providers

---

#### **PHASE 2: Roadmap Documentation (30 minutes)**
**Prompt**: "Document the complete roadmap from current Enhanced Mapping (Option A) to Full Database Separation (Option C). Create detailed architectural plans, migration strategies, and implementation phases for the future evolution to a complete database-like system with separated inventory and catalog data."

**Documentation Requirements**:
