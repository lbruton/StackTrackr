# Unified Agent Workflow Instructions
**Version**: 1.0  
**Updated**: August 14, 2025

This document defines the standard workflow protocols that all agents (GPT, Claude, and Gemini) must follow when working on the StackTrackr project.

## Git Checkpoint Protocol

### Before Starting a Task
Always create a git checkpoint before starting implementation:

```bash
# Create checkpoint before starting
git add -A
git commit -m "Create checkpoint before [task name]

- Current state description
- What's about to be implemented
- Why this change is needed"
```

### After Completing a Task
Always create a git checkpoint after completion:

```bash
# Create checkpoint after completion
git add -A
git commit -m "Complete [task name]

- Summary of changes made
- Files modified
- Performance improvements (if applicable)
- Testing verification"
```

## File Naming Conventions

### Task Files
- Location: `/agents/tasks/`
- Format: `[agent]-task-[feature]-[component].ai`
- Example: `gpt-task-search-storage.ai`

### Handoff Files
- Location: `/agents/tasks/`
- Format: `[agent]-to-[agent]-handoff-[task].ai`
- Example: `gpt-to-claude-handoff-filters.ai`

### Patch Documentation
- Location: `/agents/patch/`
- Format: `PATCH-[version].ai`
- Example: `PATCH-3.04.75.ai`

## Task Documentation Structure

All task files should follow this structure:

```markdown
# [Task Name]
**Version**: [version]
**Created**: [date]
**Status**: [status]

---

## üéØ **TASK OVERVIEW**
[Brief description of the task]

### Objectives:
1. [Objective 1]
2. [Objective 2]
...

### Success Criteria:
- [Criterion 1]
- [Criterion 2]
...

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **IMPLEMENTATION STEPS**

### Phase 1: [Phase Name] ([time estimate])
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
...

### Phase 2: [Phase Name] ([time estimate])
...

---

## üìÅ **FILE LOCATIONS**
[List of files to be modified]

---

## üìö **TECHNICAL CONTEXT**
[Relevant code snippets or explanations]

---

## üîó **DEPENDENCIES**
[List of dependencies or pre-requisites]

---

## ‚úÖ **COMPLETION CHECKLIST**
[List of items to check before marking task as complete]

---

**Assigned to**: [Agent Name]
**Priority**: [Priority Level]
**Due Date**: [Date]
```

## Handoff Protocol

When handing off a task to another agent:

1. Create a detailed handoff document in `/agents/tasks/` following the naming convention
2. Include:
   - Current state summary
   - Completed work
   - Remaining tasks
   - Known issues or challenges
   - Context that may not be apparent from the code
3. Reference relevant files and code snippets
4. Explicitly state what the next agent should focus on

## Status Reporting

Use these status indicators consistently:

- ‚è±Ô∏è **Pending**: Task not yet started
- üöß **In Progress**: Work has begun but is not complete
- ‚úÖ **Complete**: Task finished successfully
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Blocked**: Work cannot proceed due to dependencies
- üîÑ **Review**: Completed but needs verification

## Documentation Guidelines

- Use standard markdown formatting
- Include code snippets with proper syntax highlighting
- Be concise but thorough
- Focus on implementation details and reasoning
- Reference relevant documentation or sources
- Use headings to organize content

By following these unified workflow instructions, all agents will maintain consistency in project management, documentation, and version control practices.
