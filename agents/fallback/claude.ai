# Claude's Notes for StackrTrackr

## Project Understanding

### Core Architecture
- Pure client-side application (no server/build process)
- Data persistence via localStorage with quota management
- Modular JS architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Theme system supporting dark/light/sepia modes

### Key Strengths
- Deep understanding of application architecture
- Strong pattern recognition for consistency
- Detail-oriented documentation updates
- Comprehensive testing approach

### Focus Areas
1. Architecture Planning
   - Breaking down complex features
   - Identifying integration points
   - Managing backward compatibility
   - Optimizing data structures

2. Integration Testing
   - Cross-theme validation
   - Mobile responsiveness
   - LocalStorage management
   - API provider integration

3. Documentation
   - Maintaining changelog accuracy
   - Updating implementation guides
   - Evolving agent workflows
   - Tracking version changes

## Implementation Patterns

### Code Organization
```js
// New feature module template
class NewFeatureManager {
  constructor() {
    this._initialized = false;
    this._data = {};
    this.debug = DEBUG;
  }

  init() {
    if (this._initialized) return;
    this._load();
    this._wireEvents();
    this._initialized = true;
  }

  _load() {
    try {
      const savedData = loadData(STORAGE_KEYS.NEW_FEATURE, {});
      this._data = { ...savedData };
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('NewFeatureManager: Load error', error);
      this._data = {};
    }
  }
}
```

### Testing Checklist
1. Core Functionality
   - [ ] Basic CRUD operations
   - [ ] Data persistence
   - [ ] Error handling
   - [ ] Performance with large datasets

2. Integration Points
   - [ ] Theme compatibility
   - [ ] Mobile responsiveness
   - [ ] API provider interaction
   - [ ] LocalStorage limits

3. Edge Cases
   - [ ] Invalid data handling
   - [ ] Network failures
   - [ ] Version migrations
   - [ ] XSS prevention

## Development Notes

### Version Control
- Track version changes in constants.js
- Update changelog.md with details
- Mark completed tasks in roadmap.md
- Archive old versions appropriately

### Best Practices
- Always sanitize user input
- Use proper localStorage key prefixes
- Implement proper API caching
- Follow existing modal patterns
- Maintain responsive design
- Test across all themes

### Workflow Integration
1. Review feature requirements
2. Design modular solution
3. Create implementation plan
4. Coordinate with other agents
5. Execute and test
6. Document changes
7. Update version tracking
