**Auto-assign if**: Application-breaking, data loss risk, security vulnerability

### **🐛 Bug Fixes** (Non-critical)  
**Keywords**: bug, issue, problem, incorrect, wrong
**Auto-assign if**: UX impact but not breaking, cosmetic issues, minor problems

### **🔧 Feature Enhancements** (Improve existing)
**Keywords**: improve, enhance, optimize, better, faster, update
**Auto-assign if**: Modifying existing functionality, performance improvements

### **⭐ New Features** (Add functionality)
**Keywords**: add, create, new, implement, feature, capability
**Auto-assign if**: Brand new functionality, major additions

### **🏗️ Backend & Architecture** (Infrastructure)
**Keywords**: architecture, infrastructure, system, database, framework
**Auto-assign if**: Technical infrastructure, tooling, system-level changes

### **🧪 Testing & QA** (Quality assurance)

### **🎯 Current Sprint** (Active work)
