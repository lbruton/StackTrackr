# Gemini Task Assignment: Chart Cleanup & Testing Validation
## Agent: Gemini | Estimated Time: 25 minutes | Risk: Low

**Parent Task**: StackTrackr Performance Optimization  
**Gemini Specialization**: Memory management and systematic testing  
**Assigned Phases**: Phase 5 + Phase 6

## 🎯 PHASE 5: CHART CLEANUP (10 minutes)
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Memory leak prevention

### **Objective**
Ensure proper Chart.js instance cleanup to prevent memory leaks in modal operations and maintain stable memory usage over time.

### **Current Implementation**
Chart instances may not be properly cleaned up when modals are closed/reopened, leading to memory accumulation.

### **Required Changes**

**1. Enhanced cleanup in `js/charts.js`:**
```javascript
/**
 * Comprehensive Chart.js cleanup function
 * Properly destroys all chart instances and clears references
 */
const cleanupAllCharts = () => {
  // Cleanup existing chart instances
  Object.keys(chartInstances).forEach(key => {
    const chart = chartInstances[key];
    if (chart && typeof chart.destroy === 'function') {
      try {
        chart.destroy();
        debugLog(`✓ Chart '${key}' destroyed successfully`);
      } catch (error) {
        console.warn(`Chart cleanup warning for '${key}':`, error);
      }
    }
  });
  
  // Clear all references
  Object.keys(chartInstances).forEach(key => {
    delete chartInstances[key];
  });
  
  debugLog('All chart instances cleaned up');
};

// Export for global use
window.cleanupAllCharts = cleanupAllCharts;
```

**2. Update `js/detailsModal.js`:**
- Call `cleanupAllCharts()` before creating new charts
- Ensure cleanup happens on modal close
- Add ResizeObserver cleanup if present

**3. Modal lifecycle management:**
- Cleanup on modal open (before creating new charts)
- Cleanup on modal close (prevent accumulation)
- Cleanup on page unload (browser memory management)

### **Testing Requirements:**
- ✅ Charts display correctly after cleanup
- ✅ Modal can be opened/closed repeatedly without issues
- ✅ Memory usage stays stable over multiple operations
- ✅ No console errors during chart operations

---

## 🎯 PHASE 6: TESTING & VALIDATION (15 minutes)
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Must complete thoroughly

### **Objective**
Comprehensive testing of all performance improvements to ensure no regressions and verify performance gains.

### **Core Functionality Tests**

**1. Search & Filter Testing:**
```javascript
// Test scenarios to verify:
- Search with 1 character (should debounce)
- Search with rapid typing (should not lag)
- Large inventory search (100+ items)
- Filter combinations still work
- Search clear functionality intact
```

**2. Table Operations Testing:**
```javascript
// Test scenarios to verify:
- Add new inventory item
- Edit existing items (inline and modal)
- Delete items (single and multiple)
- Sorting by all columns
- Pagination navigation
- Items per page changes
```

**3. Data Persistence Testing:**
```javascript
// Test scenarios to verify:
- Rapid edits save correctly
- Import operations complete successfully
- Export functions work (CSV, JSON, PDF)
- Backup/restore functionality
- No data loss during rapid changes
```

**4. Modal & Chart Testing:**
```javascript
// Test scenarios to verify:
- Details modal opens correctly
- Charts render without errors
- Modal close doesn't leak memory
- Multiple modal open/close cycles
- Chart interactions still work
```

### **Performance Measurements**

**1. Search Performance:**
```javascript
// Measure and document:
- Search response time (target: <100ms)
- Typing lag (should be eliminated)
- Large dataset handling (1000+ items)
```

**2. Memory Usage:**
```javascript
// Measure and document:
- Baseline memory usage
- Memory after 10 modal open/close cycles
- Memory growth over extended use
- Chart cleanup effectiveness
```

**3. Render Performance:**
```javascript
// Measure and document:
- Table render time with large datasets
- DOM manipulation improvements
- localStorage operation speed
```

### **Browser Compatibility Testing**
- ✅ Chrome (primary target)
- ✅ Safari (macOS compatibility)
- ✅ Firefox (cross-browser verification)
- ✅ Mobile Safari (responsive design)

## 🚨 CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERIA

### **Must Pass Tests:**
1. **No Data Loss**: All data operations must preserve integrity
2. **No Regressions**: All existing features must work unchanged
3. **Performance Gains**: Measurable improvements in responsiveness
4. **Memory Stability**: No memory leaks detectable
5. **Cross-Browser**: Works on all supported browsers

### **Performance Targets:**
