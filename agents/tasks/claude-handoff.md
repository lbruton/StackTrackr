# Handoff Task for Claude

## Task Overview
The application initialization is failing due to unresolved issues with the `loadInventory` function and other dependencies. Despite multiple fixes, the following problems persist:

### Key Issues
1. **Application Initialization Error**:
   - `Can't find variable: loadInventory`
   - The function is exposed globally but still not recognized during initialization.

2. **Script Loading Order**:
   - Potential issues with the order of script loading in `index.html`.
   - Duplicate script tags were removed, but further validation is needed.

3. **Cross-Origin Resource Errors**:
   - Local resources are blocked due to browser security restrictions.
   - Requires serving the project via a local HTTP server.

4. **Undefined Variables**:
   - `CATALOG_MAP_KEY` and other variables are not properly imported or defined.

5. **Duplicate Variable Declarations**:
   - Errors in `fuzzy-search.js` and `inventory.js` related to duplicate declarations.

### Steps Taken
- Fixed SVG height attribute in `index.html`.
- Removed duplicate script tags for `catalog-manager.js` and `fuzzy-search.js`.
- Exposed `loadInventory` globally in `inventory.js`.
- Defined missing functions (`showDetailsModal`, etc.) in respective files.

### Pending Tasks
1. Debug and resolve the `loadInventory` initialization error.
2. Validate script loading order in `index.html`.
3. Address cross-origin resource errors by serving the project via HTTP.
4. Ensure all required variables are properly imported and defined.
5. Fix duplicate variable declarations in `fuzzy-search.js` and `inventory.js`.

## Suggested Next Steps
1. **Debugging**:
   - Use browser developer tools to trace the `loadInventory` error.
   - Verify the scope and accessibility of the function.

2. **Script Loading**:
   - Reorder scripts in `index.html` to ensure dependencies are loaded first.

3. **Local Server**:
   - Start a local HTTP server using `python3 -m http.server`.

4. **Code Review**:
   - Review `fuzzy-search.js` and `inventory.js` for duplicate declarations.

5. **Testing**:
   - Test the application in multiple browsers to identify compatibility issues.

## Resources
- `index.html`: Script loading order.
- `js/inventory.js`: `loadInventory` function.
- `js/fuzzy-search.js`: Duplicate declarations.
- Browser console logs for debugging.

## Notes
Please prioritize resolving the `loadInventory` error as it is critical for application initialization. Once fixed, validate the entire application flow to ensure no further issues.
