# Handoff Task from GPT to Claude

## Task Overview
This is an example handoff document that demonstrates the proper format for transferring work between agents. This template should be used whenever GPT needs to hand off work to another agent.

### Key Accomplishments
1. **Feature Implementation**:
   - Implemented feature X with capabilities A, B, and C
   - Added unit tests for new functionality
   - Updated documentation to reflect changes

2. **Bug Fixes**:
   - Resolved issue with function Y not handling edge case Z
   - Fixed styling inconsistencies in component W

3. **Performance Improvements**:
   - Optimized localStorage operations with batching
   - Reduced rendering time by 35%

### Pending Tasks
1. **Architecture Changes**:
   - Refactor module X to use the new architecture pattern
   - Update dependency injection for components A, B, and C

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Verify cross-browser compatibility
   - Test performance under high load conditions

3. **Documentation**:
   - Update API references
   - Create usage examples for new features

## Relevant Files
- `js/module-x.js`: Core implementation of feature X
- `js/module-y.js`: Dependencies for feature X
- `css/component-w.css`: Updated styling

## Technical Context
Feature X requires careful coordination with the existing event system. The implementation uses the strategy pattern to allow for extensibility. The most critical section is the event handling in `handleSpecialEvent()` which must maintain backwards compatibility.

## Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge**: Performance degradation with large datasets
  - **Solution**: Implemented virtualization and pagination
  
- **Challenge**: Cross-browser compatibility issues
  - **Solution**: Added polyfills and browser-specific handling

## Next Steps
1. Review the architecture changes in `module-x.js`
2. Implement the pending integration tests
3. Complete documentation updates
4. Deploy to staging for validation
